		We're talking away
		I don't know what
		I'm to say I'll say it anyway
		Today's another day to find you
		Shying away
		I'll be coming for your love, okay?
		Take on me (take on me)
		Take me on (take on me)
		I'll be gone
		In a day or two
		So needless to say
		I'm odds and ends
		But I'll be stumbling away
		Slowly learning that life is okay
		Say after me
		It's no better to be safe than sorry
